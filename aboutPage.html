    The end of result grades assigned by lecturers are intended to convey the level of achievement of each student in the
    class. These grades (result) are used to make a multitude of decisions. Unless a sufficiently accurate and efficient
    method is used for the grading, the grades are apt to convey misinformation and lead the decision-maker astray.
    In itself, the processing of results is found to be rather tedious, especially when carried out manually, and when the
    number of students is large. It is time-consuming and error prone. The process, however, becomes a lot easier and much
    more accurate when carried out with a computer running a suitable software application (Implementation of a Result
    Engine). To find a sufficiently fast and accurate method of carrying out this processing is a problem that is both
    challenging and interesting.
    In this work, a computer software application (Implementation of a Result Engine) was developed to facilitate the
    automated processing of the results using a computer engine.
    The programming languages used for the software implementation was hypertext mark-up language (HTML), cascading style
    sheet (CSS), and Java script for the front-end interface while bootstrap was employed to give beautification to user
    experience. (Responsiveness and user friendly) The system will able to compute grade point average (GPA) and cumulative
    grade point average (CGPA) for each student and easy access to all users anytime
    The developed software performed well and produced expected results on completion. With it, it was possible to compute
    Grade Point Average and Cumulative Grade Point Average for each student based on examination scores entered being the
    core idea behind the design
